description: This 1883 juvenile novel, a sequel to Eggleston's first and best-known
  novel, The Hoosier School-Master , is based on the experiences of Eggleston's brother
  as a teacher. It offers considered criticisms of rural educational practices in
  Indiana but is also full of nostalgia for a bygone time in American life.
